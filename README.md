# AWS-EC2

For some research work I had to set up R, RStudio, and Python running on Ubuntu EC2 machines. We did not want to use an already available community image becasue of some security weaknesses. I found some blogs but was not satisfied with the procedure. After some trial and error and some help I figured out the set up.
