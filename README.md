# AWS-EC2

For some research work I had to set up R (>3.6), RStudio Server (free version), and Python running on Ubuntu EC2 machines. I found some blogs, but was not satisfied with the procedure. I also found a few available community image for RStudio Server, but was not sure with the security protocols in the configurations, particulalry in the RStudio-Server.  

After some trial and error and some help I figured out the set up. If you are using sensitive data and trying to set up the free version of the RStudio-Server you might find the procedure useful.
