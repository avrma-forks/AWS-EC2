# AWS-EC2

For some research work I had to set up R (>3.6), RStudio Server (free version), and Python running on Ubuntu EC2 machines. I found some blogs but was not satisfied with the procedure. I also found a few available community image for RStudio Server but was not fully satisfied with the configuration.  After some trial and error and some help I figured out the set up.
